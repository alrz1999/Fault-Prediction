load data in proper format(token-level, line-level, method-level, class-level, file-level, module-level, release-level, project-level)
preprocess data
train and generate embedding for desired building block(word2vec, pretrained language models)
now we have a vector of features for every building block and we have a label which specifies building block bug state
now we use a machine learning or deep learning model for learning classification
the trained model is evaluated and used on test data




data gathering
    collecting data with different formats from different projects



    generating csv file for model









data ----> embedding ----> model
